## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
for(i in 1:length(Debts$name)) {
  name <- Debts$name[i]
  rmarkdown::render("debts.Rmd", 
                    params = list(N = i),
                    output_file = paste0(name, "-debts.pdf")
  )
}
```
